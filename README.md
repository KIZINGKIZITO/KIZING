# 📘 README: Simple Python Calculator

## ✨ Overview
This is a beginner-friendly Python script that acts as a **basic calculator**. It takes two numbers as input from the user and performs four fundamental arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**. The results are then displayed in a clear and cheerful format. 🎉

## 🧠 Features
- Accepts **decimal numbers** using `float()` for precision.
- Performs:
  - ➕ Addition
  - ➖ Subtraction
  - ✖️ Multiplication
  - ➗ Division
- Outputs results with friendly commentary and emojis for extra flair!

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
2. **Type Conversion**: Uses `float()` to ensure the numbers can include decimals.
3. **Calculations**:
   - `sum_result = num1 + num2`
   - `difference_result = num1 - num2`
   - `product_result = num1 * num2`
   - `quotient_result = num1 / num2`
4. **Output**: Displays the results in a readable format.

## ⚠️ Note
- This script assumes the user will not divide by zero. No error handling is included for that case—so be responsible! 😅

## 🧪 Example Run
```plaintext
Enter the first number: 12.5
Enter the second number: 3.5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 16.0
Difference: 9.0
Product: 43.75
Quotient: 3.5714285714285716
```

## 🚀 How to Run
Just copy the code into a `.py` file and run it using Python 3:
```bash
python calculator.py
```

## 🙌 Author's Note
This script is perfect for learning how to:
- Use `input()` and `float()`
- Perform basic arithmetic
- Format output with `f-strings`
- Add personality to your code with comments and emojis!
